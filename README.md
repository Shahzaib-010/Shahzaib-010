Hi👋
I'm Shahzaib. I build scalable web applications using the MERN stack. I love solving complex structural problems and wrapping them in simple, intuitive designs.

Frontend: React / Redux / Framer Motion
Backend: Node.js / Express / MongoDB
Philosophy: If it's not responsive, it's not finished.

and a lot of caffeine 🍵 :)
